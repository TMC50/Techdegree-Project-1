        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My formal education primarily focused on Kinesiology. Corporate fitness has encompassed a majority of my professional life. Over the years, I have worked to provide people with the life-long knowledge, power, and inspiration to take their health and fitness to levels they may have never thought possible, and it has been incredibly fulfilling for me. I consider myself to be extremely fortunate to have met many talented and skilled individuals throughout my health and fitness career, as well as held various positions/titles at the companies I've worked for. Health and fitness has always been and will always be a life-long passion, and keeping a healthy and active life-style continues to be of the utmost importance. However, professionally, the time had come to embark on a new and exciting career path to satisfy further interests.</p>
        <p>In summer of 2021, my incredible journey into web development began, and I knew instantly that web development would be my career aspiration. As an artistic, passionate, creative, open-minded individual, who craves seeing projects come to fruition, web development fits naturally into my professional life. The vast possibilities that web design provides creates a fun and unique environment to satisfy my creative sole and work-life at the same time.</p>
        <p>I am a person of many interests &lpar;among the two, fitness and web development, explained above&rpar; that fuel my zest for life. I am an avid aviation enthusiast, both full-scale and model aviation. I enjoy spending time going to airshows, occassionally getting flight time in full-scale aircraft, and flying remote control turbine jets. To relax and focus on the simple things in life, I love hiking and backpacking with my family and friends. Backpacking destinations often provide surreal experiences, nature, and life-lessons that can be difficult to relate to any other way, and I find that it's a magical way to positively reset the mind and body.</p>
        <p>Through web design, I hope to combine many of my interests and passions in life, which would truly be a dream come true. As a web designer, I look forward to helping individuals and companies feed the passions, interests, and business ventures that they have in life.</p>
