        <h2 class="card-title">Background</h2>
        <p>My formal education focused primarily on Kinesiology, which is a subject matter I have always had great interest in. Corporate fitness has encompassed a majority of my professional life. Over the years, I have worked to provide people with the life-long knowledge, experience, and inspiration to take their health and fitness to levels they may have never thought possible. My client's success has also been incredibly fulfilling for me because I can relate to the dedication, effort, time, and knowledge that goes into such important ventures. I have been extremely fortunate to have met many talented and skilled individuals throughout my health and fitness career, as well as have held various positions/titles at the companies I've worked for. Health and fitness has always been and will always be a life-long passion, and maintaining a healthy and active life-style continues to be of high importance. However, professionally, the time had come to embark on a new and exciting career path to satisfy further interests and challenges.</p>
        <p>In summer of 2021, my incredible journey into web development began, and I knew instantly that it would be my career aspiration. As an artistic, passionate, creative, open-minded individual, who craves seeing projects come to fruition, web development fits naturally into my professional life. The vast possibilities that web design provides creates a fun and unique environment to satisfy my creative soul.</p>
        <p>I am a person of many interests &lpar;among fitness and web development as explained above&rpar;, and they all help fuel my zest for life. I enjoy pushing my creative limits using CAD &lpar;Computer-Aided Design&rpar; programs to create 3D models of items, and bringing them to life via 3D printing. There is always something to learn from each project, and it provides me with a healthy dose of problem-solving and it's a excellent learning experience. I am an avid aviation enthusiast, both full-scale and model aviation. I enjoy spending time going to airshows, occassionally getting flight time piloting full-scale aircraft, as well as piloting remote control jet aircraft. To relax and focus on the simple things in life, I love hiking and backpacking with my family and friends. Backpacking destinations often provide surreal experiences, incredible forms of nature, great exercise, and life-lessons. I find hiking and backpacking to be almost magical, and it's a positive and effective way to reset the mind and body.</p>
        <p>Through web design, I hope to combine many of my interests and passions in life, which would truly be a dream come true. As a web designer, I look forward to helping individuals and companies portray the interests, passions, and business ventures that they have in life.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Goals</h2>
        <p>I strive for excellence, and I believe this is achieved through education and practical experience, so a primary goal of mine is to continue embracing the notion and practice of life-long learning.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I want to master the process of building amazing web sites, as well as increase my knowledge and applications in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With this knowledge and experience, I would like to work with companies in the fitness, aerospace, outdoor recreation, and remote control model industries to design websites that effectively capture the clients needs and provide them with impressive online presentation and functionality.</p>
